The mikhail-7.4-covmat files are derived from mikhail-7.4 example

Files mikhail-7.4.gkf and mikhail-7.4-cov.gkf are identical.
Files mikhail-7.4.xml and mikhail-7.4-cov.xml are identical.

In the testing file mikhail-7.4-cov.yaml distances in kilometres
are removed and replaced with commond diagonal variance-covariance
matrix, where

    dh weight = 1/dist_km, var = apr_0^2/weight and apr_0 is 10

This test proves that results are same as in original observation
data.
