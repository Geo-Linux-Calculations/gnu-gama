GNU GaMa (http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/) source codes can be
downloaded from FTP

           http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html
or CVS
           http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gama/          

Archive of old versions is 

           http://gama.fsv.cvut.cz/~cepek/gama/archive


--------------------------

For building Gama project shared library of expat XML parser must be
installed.  To build all Gama run

                  make dep
                  make


--------------------------

For parsing XML input, Gama can use old version of parser expat v. 1.1
copyrighted by James Clark. The source code of this version is
distributed together with Gama to enable building of Gama executables
on systems where expat shared library is not available.

Place the parser source into subdirectory `expat' located in the same
directory in which are located subdirectories `gnu_gama', `gmatvec',
etc. and run
                   make dep-expat-1.1
                   make 

---------------------------

Project GaMa was developed and tested under Debian GNU/Linux.  Apart
from GNU g++, the project was tested with bcc32 (Borland free command
line tools) and with MS Visual C++ (not the latest versions).

      To build command line program gama for win32 platform 
      change to gamaprog/win32-borland and run `make' or go to
      gamaprog/win32-msvc and run `nmake'.

      Makefiles for win32 platform are not stored at CVS and can 
      be build using  scripts/win32-makefiles.bat

---------------------------

GNU GaMa is also available from CVS at 

              http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gama

You can download source codes from Savannah and build them under
GNU/Linux but not under win32 platform (you would be missing some
files like language.h etc that are generated during Lunix build).
