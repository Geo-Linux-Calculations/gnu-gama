Project GaMa source code can be downloaded from

         http://gama.fsv.cvut.cz/gama/archive/gamalib/1.3/

or any later version.

For parsing XML input, gamalib uses parser expat v. 1.1 copyrighted by
James Clark, which can downloaded directly from

                   ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip

or a copy from

           http://gama.fsv.cvut.cz/gama/archive/expat/expat.zip

Place the parser source into subdirectory `expat' located in the same
directory in which are located subdirectories `gamalib', `gmatvec',
etc. and run 
                   make build 
                   make example

Project GaMa was developed and tested under Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
Apart from g++, the project was tested with bcc32 (Borland free
command line tools) and with MS Visual C++ (not the latest versions).
