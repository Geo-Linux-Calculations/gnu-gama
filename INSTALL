GNU GaMa (http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/) source codes can be
downloaded from FTP

           http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html
or CVS
           http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gama/          

Archive of old versions is 

           http://gama.fsv.cvut.cz/gama/archive/gamalib/


For parsing XML input, gamalib uses parser expat v. 1.1 copyrighted by
James Clark, which can downloaded directly from

                   ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip

or a copy from

           http://gama.fsv.cvut.cz/gama/archive/expat/expat.zip

Place the parser source into subdirectory `expat' located in the same
directory in which are located subdirectories `gamalib', `gmatvec',
etc. and run 
                   make dep
                   make 


---------------------------

Project GaMa was developed and tested under Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
Apart from GNU g++, the project was tested with bcc32 (Borland free
command line tools) and with MS Visual C++ (not the latest versions).

      To build command line program gama for win32 platform 
      change to gamaprog/win32-borland and run `make' or go to
      gamaprog/win32-msvc and run `nmake'.


---------------------------

GNU GaMa is also available from CVS at 

              http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gama

You can download source codes from Savannah and build them under
GNU/Linux but not under win32 platform (you would be missing some
files like language.h etc that are generated during Lunix build).
