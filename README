GNU package Gama is a C++ free software for geodesy released under GNU
General Public Licence. Project Gama was started in 1998, in 2001 was
dubbed a GNU packaqe and today contains the following main components:

    [compiler] To build Gama, the compiler must support c++11
    standard. Purposefully there are no constructs based on c++14 xto
    enable builds with a wider range of available compilers. To check
    the compiler support of c++11 features, configure.ac calls macro
    AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11, you need either to install package
    autoconf-archive or download it from
    git://git.sv.gnu.org/autoconf-archive.git. See
    https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.html

    [gamalib] C++ class library for handling geodetic observations
    (measurements) and points (coordinates), computation of
    approximate coordinates (needed for linearization) and adjustment
    of local geodetic networks in 3d.  C API to essential gamalib C++
    classes and functions is also available. Numerical solution of
    adjustment is based on orthogonal decomposition of the design
    matrix (ie without "normal equations"); currently supported
    algorithms are SVD and GSO (an algorithm based on Gram-Schmidt
    orthogonalisation). Adjustment on the ellipsoid is a long term
    goal.

    [program gama-local] C++ program for adjustment of horizontal
    geodetic network based on gamalib (also available as a public
    service accessible by email); format of input data is defined in
    XML. Data structures used in adjustment enable usage of general
    variance-covariance matrices of observations and are designed to
    enable implementation of sparse matrices in future versions.

    [matvec] C++ matrix/vector template classes used in adjustment
    computations in gamalib.
