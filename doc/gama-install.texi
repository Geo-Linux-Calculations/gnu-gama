GNU Gama is developed and tested under Debian GNU/Linux
(@uref{http://www.debian.org/}).  A static library @code{libgama.lib}
and executables are build in folders @code{lib} and @code{bin}.
You can compile Gama easily yourself if you download the
sources.  If @code{expat} XML parser is installed on your system,
change to the directory of Gama project and issue the following
commands at the shell prompt

@example
$ ./configure
$ make
@end example

@noindent If the script @code{configure} is not available (which is the
case when you download source codes from a git server), you have to
generate it using auxiliary script @code{autogen.sh}.  To compile and
build all binaries. Run

@example
$ ./configure [--bindir=DIR --infodir=DIR]
$ make install
@end example

@noindent if you want also to install the binaries. You can use configure 
pararameters if you need to change directories where user executables
and info dosumentation should be installed.
