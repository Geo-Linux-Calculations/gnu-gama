GNU Gama is developed and tested under Debian GNU/Linux
(@uref{http://www.debian.org/}). You can compile Gama easily
yourself if you download the sources.  If @code{expat} XML parser
is installed on your system, change to the directory of Gama project
and issue the following commands at the shell prompt:
@c
@example
$ make dep
$ make
$ make example
@end example
@c
If for any reason @code{expat} is not installed on your system, you
can still compile and build Gama with old version @code{expat 1.1}
that is shipped with Gama
@c
@example
$ make dep-expat-1.1
$ make
@end example


To compile GNU Gama under Windows (command-line tool
@code{gama-local}) you need makefiles for Microsoft @code{nmake}
and/or Borland free compiler @code{bcc32}. These makefiles are build
under GNU/Linux by @code{scripts/build-old-makefiles}.  The script
must be run with an argument @code{win32-msvc}, @code{win32-borland} or
@code{gnu} for creating corresponding makefiles. The script writes
makefiles into the @code{lib} directory.

After building makefiles you also need to edit
@code{lib/gnu_gama/version.cpp} to set manually the version of GNU
Gama and comment out the include directive for @code{config.h}.

Under Windows start a DOS window, change to the directory @code{lib}
and run @code{nmake -f Makefile-all-win32-msvc} or @code{make -f
Makefile-all-win32-borlan}. Executables are created in the @code{lib}
folder.
