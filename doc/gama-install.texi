GNU Gama is developed and tested under Debian GNU/Linux
(@uref{http://www.debian.org/}). You can compile Gama easily
yourself if you download the sources.  If @code{expat} XML parser
is installed on your system, change to the directory of Gama project
and issue the following commands at the shell prompt:
@c
@example
$ make dep
$ make
$ make example
@end example
@c
If for any reason @code{expat} is not installed on your system, you
can still compile and build Gama with old version @code{expat 1.1}
that is shipped with Gama
@c
@example
$ make dep-expat-1.1
$ make
@end example


To compile GNU Gama under Windows (command-line tool
@code{gama-local}) start a DOS window, change to the directory
@code{gamaprog/win32-borland} and run @code{make} (for Borland free
compiler @code{bcc32}) or alternatively to the directory
@code{gamaprog/win32-msvc} and run Microsoft @code{nmake}.
