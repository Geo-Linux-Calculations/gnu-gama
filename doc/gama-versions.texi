The GNU GaMa is a project dedicated to adjustment of @emph{geodetic
networks}. It was formerly inspired by software system Geodet/PC
(1990) designed by Frantisek Charamza. The project has been started at
the department of mapping and cartography, faculty of Civil
Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) about 1998 and
its name is an acronym for @emph{geodesy and mapping}.  It was
presented to wider public for the first time at FIG Working Week 2000
in Prague and then at FIG Workshop and Seminar at HUT Helsinki in
2001.

Stable version 1.4 of the project is limited to network adjustment in
a local coordinate system. In the unstable development version 1.5
adjustment model is going to be based on geocentric coordinate system.


GNU GaMa stable version 1.4 adjusts geodetic (free) networks of
observed distances, directions, angles, height differences, 3D vectors
and observed coordinates (coordinates with given variance-covariance
matrix).

GNU GaMa is based on a free library of geodetic classes and functions
@code{GaMaLib} written in C++ released under GNU General Public
Licence.  Geodetic network adjustment is available in the stable
version 1.4 as a command line program @code{gama}. 
@c
Rocinante is the GNU GaMa GUI based on the Qt graphical
library. Rocinante is documented separatedly, for more information see

         @center @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/rocinante/}


GNU GaMa stable branch version 1.4 can be found on in the subdirectory
@code{/gnu/gama/} on your favorite
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.html, GNU mirror} or from the CVS as
the branch @code{gama-1-4}.  See our project page at
@uref{http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gama/, savannah} for more
information.  

Unstable branch version 1.5 of GNU GaMa is available from the CVS on
the main trunk.  Archive of previous versions (both stable and
unstable) is available at
@uref{http://gama.fsv.cvut.cz/gama/archive/}.


To get an anonymous read-only access to the CVS repository for the
latest GNU GaMa unstable source, submit the following commands

@example
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gama login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gama co gama
@end example

@noindent or

@example
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gama 
         co -r gama-1-4 gama
@end example

@noindent for the stable branch @code{gama-1-4}.

Working version of manual for the unstable version 1.5 in the Texinfo
format is avalable from CVS as
@example
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@@subversions.gnu.org:/webcvs
         co software/gama/unstable
@end example

@noindent If you do not have program @code{makeinfo} for processing 
Texinfo documentation format we can send you unstable documentation as
a plain ASCII file or in HTML, dvi, ps or pdf format.
