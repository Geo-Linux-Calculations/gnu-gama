Surveying is the technique and science of accurately determining the
terrestrial or three-dimensional space position of points and the
distances and angles between them.@footnote{Wikipedia,
@uref{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying}} GNU Gama is a software
for adjustment of traditional geodetic surveyings which are still used
and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or high
precision engineering measurements) where GPS cannot be used.

Adjustment is a technical term traditional used by geodesists and
surveyors which simply means "application of Least Squares method to
process the over-determined system of measurements" (other statistical
method than Least Square are used sometimes but are not common). In
other words we have more observations than needed and we are trying to
get the best estimate for adjusted observations and/or coordinates.

@emph{Adjustment of geodetic networks} means that we have a set of
points with given coordinates coordinates of some points and a set of
observations among them. What is typical for adjustment of special
geodetic measurements is that the resulting linearised system might be
singular (we can have a network with no fixed points) and we are not
only interested in values of 'adjusted parameters and observations'
but also in the estimates of their covariances. This is what Gama
does.

GNU Gama is a project dedicated to adjustment of @emph{geodetic
networks}. It was formerly inspired by Fortran system Geodet/PC (1990)
designed by Frantisek Charamza. The GNU Gama project started
at the department of mapping and cartography, faculty of Civil
Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) about 1998 and
its name is an acronym for @emph{geodesy and mapping}.  It was
presented to wider public for the first time at FIG Working Week 2000
in Prague and then at FIG Workshop and Seminar at HUT Helsinki in
2001.

GNU Gama is released under GNU General Public Licence and is based on
a C++ library of geodetic classes and functions and a
small C++ template matrix library @code{matvec}. For parsing XML
documents GNU Gama calls @code{expat} parser version 1.1 written by
James Clark. The @code{expat} parser is not part of the GNU Gama
project, but is used with GNU Gama.

Adjustment in local carthesian coordinate systems is fully supported
by a command-line program @code{gama-local} that adjusts geodetic
(free) networks of observed distances, directions, angles, height
differences, 3D vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with
given variance-covariance matrix).  Adjustment in global coordinate
systems is supported only partly as a @code{gama-g3} program.
