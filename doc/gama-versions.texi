GNU Gama is a project dedicated to adjustment of @emph{geodetic
networks}. It was formerly inspired by Fortran system Geodet/PC (1990)
designed by Frantisek Charamza. The GNU Gama project has been started
at the department of mapping and cartography, faculty of Civil
Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) about 1998 and
its name is an acronym for @emph{geodesy and mapping}.  It was
presented to wider public for the first time at FIG Working Week 2000
in Prague and then at FIG Workshop and Seminar at HUT Helsinki in
2001.

GNU Gama is released under GNU General Public Licence and is based on
a C++ library of geodetic classes and functions and a
small C++ template matrix library @code{matvec}. For parsing XML
documents GNU Gama calls @code{expat} parser version 1.1 written by
James Clark. The @code{expat} parser is not part of the GNU Gama
project, but is used with GNU Gama.

Adjustment in local carthesian coordinate systems is fully supported
by a command-line program @code{gama-local} that adjusts geodetic
(free) networks of observed distances, directions, angles, height
differences, 3D vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with
given variance-covariance matrix).  Adjustment in global coordinate
systems is supported only partly as a @code{gama-g3} program.
