@tab Position of approximate coordinates xy of the adjusted point with
     respect to its confidence ellipse
     (g < 1 approximate coordinates are located inside the ellipse;
     g = 1 on the  ellipse; g > 1 outside the ellipse).
     Zero value of g indicates that approximate and adjusted
     coordinates are identical, this case typically happens when
     adjustement is repeated due to linearization iterations.
