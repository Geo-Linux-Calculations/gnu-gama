YAML is a human-readable data-serialization language. It is commonly
used for configuration files and in applications where data is being
stored or transmitted. YAML targets many of the same communications
applications as Extensible Markup Language but has a minimal syntax
which intentionally differs from SGML. @cite{Wikipedia}

In version 2.12 YAML support was added for gama-local as an
alternative to the existing XML input format. The YAML support is
limited only to conversion program @code{gama-local-yaml2gkf} but it
may be fully integrated in @code{gama-local} program later.

In GNU Gama YAML documents are based on four main nodes

@verbatim
   defaults:

   description:

   points:

   observations:
@end verbatim

Where @code{defaults} and @code{desctiopions} are optional and
@code{points} and @code{observations} are mandatory and each can be
used only once.

Lets start with a full example

@verbatim
   defaults:
     sigma-apr : 5
     conf-pr:    0.95

   description:
     Example of a simple network

   points:
     - id:  1783
       y:   453500.000
       x:   104500.000
       adj: xy

     - id:  2044
       y:   461000.000
       x:   101000.000
       fix: xy

   observations:
     - from: 1783
       obs:
         - type:  direction
           to:    776
           val:   29.51661
           stdev: 2.0

         - type:  direction
           to:    351
           val:   94.22790
           stdev: 2.0

     - from: 351
       obs:
         - type:  direction
           to:    2044
           val:   170.48370
           stdev: 2.0

         - type:  distance
           to:    1783
           val:   5522.668
           stdev: 10.0

     - from: 462
       obs:
         - type:  direction
           to:    2505
           val:   299.99973
           stdev: 2.0
@end verbatim

The data structure of the YAML document is defined by
@emph{indentation}, this principle was inspired by Python programming
language, where indentation is very important; Python uses indentation
to indicate a block of code.

Practically all attribute names used in out YAML format are the same
as in XML data format.

Lets have a look on some more examples. Within @code{observations:}
section we can define height differerence (another kind of a
measurement).

@verbatim
   observations:

     - height-differences:
         - dh:
             from: A
             to  : B
             val : 25.42
             dist: 18.1     # distance in km
         - dh:
             from: B
             to:   C
             val:  10.34
             dist:  9.4
@end verbatim

Two remaining observation types are @code{vectors} and
@code{coordinates}.

@verbatim
   observations:
     - vectors:
       - vec:
           from: A
           to: S
           dx: 60.0070
           dy: 35.0053
           dz: 54.9953
       - vec:
           from: B
           to: S
           dx: -39.9974
           dy: 34.9928
           dz: 54.9976
@end verbatim

and

@verbatim
   observations:
     - coordinates:
       - id: 403
         x: 1054612.59853
         y: 644373.60446
       - id: 407
         x: 1054821.17131
         y: 644025.97479

   ....

       - cov-mat:
           dim: 20
           band: 19
           upper-part:
             6.7589719e+01 1.8437742e+01 1.3176856e+01 ...
@end verbatim

Typically any observation set can define its covariance matrix.

You may wish to compare YAML and XML data files available from Gama
tests suite in tests/gama-local/input directory (files *.gkf and
*.yaml).
