Program @code{gama-local} is a simple command line tool for adjustment
of geodetic @emph{free networks.} It is available for GNU Linux (the
main platform on which project GNU GaMa is being developped) or for MS
Windows (tested with Borland compiler from Borland free command line
tools and with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler; support for Windows
platform is currently limited to maintaing compatibility with the two
mentioned compilers).

@c ??? @code{gama-local} fails with TeX ???
@c
Program @code{gama-local} reads input data in XML format 
@ifnottex
(@ref{XML input data format for @code{gama-local}}) 
@end ifnottex
and prints adjustment
results into ASCII text file. If output file name is not given, input
file name with extension@code{.txt} is used.  If run without arguments
@code{gama-local} prints a short help

@example
bash-2.03$ ./gama-local

Adjustment of local geodetic network        version: 1.5.08 / GNU g++
************************************
http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/

Usage: gama-local [options] xml_input_file.gkf  [ output. ]

Options:

--algorithm svd|gso     
--language  en|cz|fi|du 
--version               
--help              this text

bash-2.03$
@end example

@noindent
Program @code{gama-local} version is followed by information on
compiler used to build the program (apart from GNU @code{g++}
compiler, two other possibilities are @code{bcc} and @code{msc} for
Borland and Microsoft compilers respectively, when build under
Microsoft Windows).


Option @code{--algorithm} enables to select numerical method used for
solution of the adjustment. Implicitly is used Singular Value
Decomposition (@code{svd}), alternatively user can decide for block
matrix algorithm GSO by Frantisek Charamza, based on Gram-Schmidt
ortogonalization. In either case project equations are solved directly
without forming @emph{normal equations}.

Option @code{--language} selects language used in output protocol. For
example, if run with option @code{--language cz}, @code{gama-local}
prints output results in Czech languague using UTF-8
encoding. Implicit value is @code{en} for output in English.
