Program @code{gama-local} is a simple command line tool for adjustment
of geodetic @emph{free networks.} It is available for GNU Linux (the
main platform on which project GNU Gama is being developped) or for MS
Windows (tested with Borland compiler from Borland free command line
tools and with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler; support for Windows
platform is currently limited to maintaing compatibility with the two
mentioned compilers).


Program @code{gama-local} reads input data in XML format (@ref{XML
input data format for gama-local}) and prints adjustment results into
ASCII text file. If output file name is not given, input file name
with extension@code{.txt} is used.  If run without arguments
@code{gama-local} prints a short help

@example

$ ./gama-local 

Adjustment of local geodetic network        version: 1.7.14 / GNU g++

--latitude   <latitude>
--ellipsoid  <ellipsoid name>
--version

@end example

@noindent
Program @code{gama-local} version is followed by information on
compiler used to build the program (apart from GNU @code{g++}
compiler, two other possibilities are @code{bcc} and @code{msc} for
Borland and Microsoft compilers respectively, when build under
Microsoft Windows).


Option @code{--algorithm} enables to select numerical method used for
solution of the adjustment. Implicitly is used Singular Value
Decomposition (@code{svd}), alternatively user can decide for block
matrix algorithm GSO by Frantisek Charamza, based on Gram-Schmidt
ortogonalization. In both these cases, project equations are solved directly
without forming @emph{normal equations}.  Third possibility is to
select Cholesky decomposition of semidefinite matrix of normal
equations (@code{cholesky}).

Option @code{--language} selects language used in output protocol. For
example, if run with option @code{--language cz}, @code{gama-local}
prints output results in Czech languague using UTF-8
encoding. Implicit value is @code{en} for output in English.

Option @code{--encoding} enables to change inplicit UTF-8 output
encoding to iso-8859-2 (latin-2), iso-8859-2-flat (latin-2 without
diacritics), cp-1250 (MS-EE encoding) cp-12251 (Russian encoding).

Option @code{--angles} selects angular units to be used in output.
